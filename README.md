# Fully Responsive Food Delivery Website

A fully responsive food delivery website created with HTML and CSS would be an attractive and user-friendly platform designed to display content seamlessly across all screen sizes and devices.
The homepage of the website should feature a hero section that showcases high-quality images of the dishes that the restaurant offers. The navigation bar should be placed at the top of the page, and it should contain links to essential pages such as "Welcome Page," "Our Services," "Our Clients," "About Us," and "Contact Us."
